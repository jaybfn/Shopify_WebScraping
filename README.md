# Shopify_WebScraping

#### Web scraping (sometimes called web data extraction or data scraping) is a technique that allows users to automatically acquire structured web data. Web scraping is a useful alternative if the public website you want to get data from doesn't have an API, or if it has but just allows you limited access to the data.

#### Scraping the web is a three-step process:
Step 1: Go to the webpage you want to scrape and make an HTTP request.
The target webpage's HTML content is returned by the server in response to the request.
Step 2: Parse the HTML content in step two.
2. To generate a layered structure of HTML data, you'll need a parser.
Step 3: Extract data from HTML
3. To extract and save data, we use Python libraries like Json and Beautiful Soup.
